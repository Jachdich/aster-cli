bugs:
	- multi line messages don't get rebuilt upon resizing the window
	- pressing tab in edit mode messes up the border
	- unicode characters like ✅ still cause a crash if they're c h o n k
	- also ✅ causes the border to get eaten away because its width is incorrectly calculated (maybe a terminal issue?)
features:
	- passwords
	- actually set & use sync data
	- changing pfp, nickname, username (across all servers)
	- try to reconnect to offline servers periodically
	- ping online servers periodically
	- images
	- markdown
	- clickable links
	- cache things like nick changes on offline servers to send when they're back online
	- try to reconnect to offline servers periodically
	- ping online servers periodically
	- server folders
	- future: when editing/deleting, use arrows to navigate and select the message, then a command to edit/delete
	- current alt key combos are kinda bad (show what is currently selected?)
	- servers & channels scroll
	- current alt key combos are kinda bad
	- store "last modified at" tags with settings (both locally and on the server) to choose the newest one
	- make it easier to switch accounts on servers if you logged in with a different one previously
	- set per-server nicknames
	- ctrl+arrows for faster navigation, plus ctrl+backspace
	- better keybinds/system for navigating around different menus
	- suggestions + tab completion for builtin commands like /join
	- support multi line editing with shift+enter
	- server folders
	- windows support maybe...
	- put on crates.io
code:
	- figure out what to do when write causes an error
	- clean up the theme system
	- rewrite the message rendering code to be better
	- prompt: max_width
	- migrate away from using raw json as much as possible
in progress:
	- figure out a more elegant way to represent servers
tentatively done:
	- config file
	- sync server support
done:
	- mouse support (servers, channels)
	- notifications
	- multi line editing
	- ask for & save username
	- pressing backspace in the prompt buffer does not remove the character from the screen
	- fix crash on unicode characters being typed in an edit buffer
	- support multiple line messages rendering
	- probably best to store messages as a list of ready-formatted lines instead of calculating them each time
	- servers don't get highlighted
