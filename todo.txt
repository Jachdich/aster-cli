bugs:
	- pressing tab in edit mode messes up the border
	- servers don't get highlighted
	- unicode characters like ✅ still cause a crash if they're c h o n k
	- also ✅ causes the border to get eaten away because its width is incorrectly calculated (maybe a terminal issue?)
	- multi line messages don't get rebuilt upon resizing the window
features:
	- passwords
	- ask for & save username
	- changing pfp, nickname, username (across all servers)
	- images
	- markdown
	- clickable links
	- multi line editing
	- cache things like nick changes on offline servers to send when they're back online
	- try to reconnect to offline servers periodically
	- server folders
	- current alt key combos are kinda bad
	- servers & channels scroll
	- store "last modified at" tags with settings (both locally and on the server) to choose the newest one
code:
	- figure out what to do when write causes an error
	- migrate away from using raw json as much as possible
	- clean up the theme system
	- prompt: max_width
	- rewrite the message rendering code to be better
in progress:
	- config file
	- sync server support
	- mouse support (servers, channels, etc)
	- figure out a more elegant way to represent servers
done:
	- pressing backspace in the prompt buffer does not remove the character from the screen
	- fix crash on unicode characters being typed in an edit buffer
	- support multiple line messages rendering
	- probably best to store messages as a list of ready-formatted lines instead of calculating them each time
